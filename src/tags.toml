# Can you add X / When will Y be added?
Movie-web doesn't host its own content, and thus we do not know when something will be added, nor can we add something ourselves. 

Think of movie-web like google, we search the web for videos but we don't add our own, we only allow people to search.

# Where does our content come from? Is it legal?
We take the content directly from other sites that host content. We do not own any of the files. We simply display what we find on other sites.

Think of it like Google, we search the Internet for videos, but we dont own the sites, nor the content. We merely link to them.

Thus, the legality of watching the video depends on what sites it took from. We do not control that however. You can check the source section of the video settings to see what site you're watching from.

iOS does not allow custom video players to go fullscreen. Because of this, our subtitle renderer is not visible when you enter fullscreen.

# Why can't I download an MP4?

Most of our sources do not support downloading an MP4 file, this is because they use HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) to serve the video. HLS is a streaming protocol, and thus does not allow downloading the video itself.

However, you can download the HLS playlist by clicking the "Download playlist" button in the download menu.
Once downloaded, use VLC to play the m3u8 playlist file.
